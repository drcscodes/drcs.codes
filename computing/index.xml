You should become good at manipulating text. The first thing you should do is pick a good cross-platform text editor and learn it well. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already done so, this guide will help you choose one. The next thing you should do is learn regular expressions, and the next thing after that is learn UNIX and one of its command shells, probably bash.</description></item><item><title>Getting Started</title><link>https://DrCS.codes/computing/getting-started/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://DrCS.codes/computing/getting-started/</guid><description>Getting Started These instructions are for installing the necessary tools and Python components for this course.

WSL2 provides a very nice Linux environment, including a full Linux kernel and distribution of your choosing (I will use the latest Ubuntu in demonstrations).</description></item><item><title>Lessons</title><link>https://DrCS.codes/computing/lessons/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://DrCS.codes/computing/lessons/</guid><description>Course Materials CNO: Computer and Network Organization Lessons # Slides Readings Exercises Projects Video 0 Introduction to Computing Meet the Teacher
