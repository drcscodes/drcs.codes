# Course Introduction

## Place In the AI Curriculum

Before CS 8375, need:

- data structures and algorithms at undergraduate level.
- Above implies discrete math (sets, logic, combinatorics, proofs, graphs).

After CS 8375, ready for (not formal prerequisites, but highly advisable):

- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning
- AI application courses:
    - Machine Vision
    - Natural Language Processing
- AI research

This course is a gateway to all of AI and machine learning.

## Workload

3-hour course means

- "3" contact hours per week,
- two hours spent outside class for every hour in class.

So you should spend, on average, 6 hours outside class on reading and assignments each weeks, or 90 hours over the course of the semester.  These numbers are upper bounds.  I will strive to undershoot them.

## Work Breakdown

- 40-50 pages of reading per week, except exam weeks
- 4 Problem Sets (PS)
- 4 Programming Assignments (PA)
- Semester project
- Midterm and Final Exams

Course designed to take 86 hours outside of class for the semester.

## Reading

- Best book on AI by a large margin.
    - Used by all the top schools.
- Reading should take 1-2 hours per week for 13 weeks, 13-26 hours total.
- My slides are like lecture notes, i.e., self-contained summaries of the material.

## Problem Sets

- Should take 1-2 hours each, 4-8 hours total.
- Designed to prepare you for the exam.

## Programming Assignments

- Should take 8-10 hours each, 32-40 hours total.
- When you build, you understand.
- Designed to prepare you to build AI systems.

## Semester Project


- Should take you 16 hours.

## Exams

- Each exam preceeded by an in-class review.
- Each exam designed to take 1 hour.
- Final exam covers the material since the midterm exam, i.e., is not comprehensive.
- Knowing the material in the problem sets and lecture slides well should get you to the A level.  Doing the reading as well should make an A comfortable.
