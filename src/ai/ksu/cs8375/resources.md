# Resources

## Course Materials

- [Course Introduction](course-intro.html)
- [Semester Project](project.html)
- [AIMA Exercises](https://aimacode.github.io/aima-exercises/)
- [Research Papers](papers.html), [.bib file](ai.bib)
- [ACM Computing Classification System](https://www.acm.org/publications/class-2012)

## Programming Environments

- Essential [Software Setup](software-setup.html) you'll need for this course.
- [iPython](../../../shared/ipython.html).  The best interactive language interpreter ever.
- (Optional, for the adventurous) [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) is the most powerful text editor there will ever be.  Its steep learning curve is repaid a thousand-fold over your lifetime.
     - On macOS: `brew install --cask emacs`, which installs [Emacs for Mac OS X](https://emacsformacosx.com/)
    - [Beginners Guide to Emacs](https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/beginners-guide-to-emacs)
    - [Dr. CS's Emacs config](https://github.com/dr-cs/dotfiles) in the `.emacs.d` directory.
- (Recommended) JetBrains [Educational Licenses](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students/)
    - [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is a good choice for a pythonista, ML engineer or data scientist.
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/).  The original modern text editor.  Excellent, but not free.  Written in [C++](https://isocpp.org/).
- [Zed](https://zed.dev/).  An intriguing new free editor in the Sublime Text tradition.  Written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  Microsoft's embrace-extend-extinguish Sublime Text clone.  Written in JavaScript/TypeScript using Electron.  Kinda meh, but many people use it.
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).  Free Jupyter Notebook service with most machine learning libraries installed and ready to use.


# Libraries

- Scipy: [NumPy](https://numpy.org), [MatPlotLib](https://matplotlib.org), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org), and more.
- [Keras](https://keras.io/)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org)
- [JAX](https://docs.jax.dev/)

## $\LaTeX$

$\LaTeX$ is a document preparation system that compiles marked up text to Postscript or, more commonly today, PDF.  All serious mathematical, scientific, and engineering publications are written in $\LaTeX$.

- [Download $\LaTeX$](https://www.latex-project.org/get/)
- [Practical $\LaTeX$](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-06425-3) -- short, inexpensive book containing all you need to get started and more.
- [Text and Math into $\LaTeX$](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-55281-6) -- if you want to become a $\LaTeX$ expert.
- [Overleaf $\LaTeX$ Tutorials](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes).  Overleaf is a web-based $\LaTeX$ service.  Good way to get started, but I recommend installing it on your machine and editing it locally, especially if you have aspirations of becoming a researcher.
