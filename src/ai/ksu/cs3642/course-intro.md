# Course Introduction

## Place In the AI Curriculum

Before CS 3642, need:

- data structures and algorithms at undergraduate level.
- Above implies discrete math (sets, logic, combinatorics, proofs, graphs).

After CS 3642, ready for:

- CS 4267 Machine Learning
- CS 4277 Deep Learning
- AI application courses:
    - CS 4732 Machine Vision
    - CS 4742 Natural Language Processing

This course is a gateway to all of AI and machine learning.

## Workload

According to [KSU policy](https://www.kennesaw.edu/research/undergraduate-research/faculty/resources/credit-hours.php), a 3-hour course means

- 2.5 instructional hours per week,
- 5 hours of work outside of class.

So you should spend 75 hours outslide of class on this course.  I use these guidelines when I design a course.

> By the way, I've realized that professors at Georgia Tech DO NOT design their courses with these workoad guidelines in mind!

## Work Breakdown

- 40-50 pages of reading per week, except exam weeks
- 4 Programming Assignments (PA)
- Semester project
- Midterm and Final Exams

## Reading

- AIMA: Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, 4ed, by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig, [https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/).  US or Global Edition.
- Best book on AI by a large margin.
    - Used by all the top schools.
- Readings should take 2 hours per week for 13 weeks, 26 hours total.
- My slides are like lecture notes, i.e., self-contained summaries of the material.
- Instead of problem sets, I will provide study guides that you can use while you read.

## Programming Assignments

- Should take 12 hours each, 48 hours total.
- When you build, you understand.
- Designed to prepare you to build AI systems.

If you add up all the time estimates for each work category, you get 74 hours.  This is an average, of course.

## Exams

- Each exam preceeded by an in-class review.
- Each exam designed to take 1 hour.
- Final exam covers the material since the midterm exam, i.e., is not comprehensive.
- Knowing the material in the study guides and lecture slides well should get you to the A level.  Doing the reading as well should make an A comfortable.
