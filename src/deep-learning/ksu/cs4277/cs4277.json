    "title": "Deep Learning",
    "description": "This course covers the foundations of Deep Learning; how to build neural networks and how to design successful deep learning projects. The course topics include convolutional networks, sequence modeling such as recurrent and recursive neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM), Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, state-of-the-art technologies, and research topics leveraging Deep Learning. The course includes programming assignments in a modern deep learning framework.",
