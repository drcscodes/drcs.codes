# Python Practice

These programming problems provide practice applying what you have learned in the lessons.  Many of these problems are also linked in the lesson listings for the appropriate course and indicate the knowledge required to complete the practice activity.

## Exercises

Exercises are designed to take no more than an hour to complete and give you practice using various features of Python.

## Projects

Projects may take several days to complete and require you to solve design problems and learn material (such as third party libraries) that are not covered directly in the lessons.  Projects are similar to small-to-medium scale tasks you might encounter on the job.
