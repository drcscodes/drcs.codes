# Drill - Values and Variables

## Introduction

Drills are very short exercises designed to exercise the most basic building blocks of modules and programs. In this drill you will create a series of values and assign them to variables to solidify your knowledge of values, variables, operators, and types.

## Solution Description

For each of the comments below, write the specified Python code. You may do this in the Python interactive shell or by creating a text file that you run from the command line or import into an interactive Python shell (which runs the code). You could copy the comments below and copy them into a text file with a .py extension.

```Python
# Assign the value 3 to the variable a. What is the type of a?
# How do you know the value of a?



# Assign the value 4 to the variable b.



# Assign the result of dividing a by b to the variable d.
# What is the type of d?



# Assign the result of dividing a by b to the variable e using *integer* division.
# What is the type of e?



# Assign the result of calculating the remainder of a `div` b to the variable f,
# where `div` means integer division.
# Hint: this operation is known as `mod` or "modulus".



# If the int values [0,7) (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) refer to Monday through Sunday,
# and today is Monday, what day of the week will it be in 999 days?



# Assign the result of the sum a squared plus b squared to the variable c.



# Assign the string value "foo" to the variable x.



# Assign the string value "fighter" to the variable y.



# Assign the value of x + y to the variable z. What is the value of z?



# Add 1 to z. What happens?
```
