* Values and Variables

** Languages and Computation

Every powerful language has three mechanisms for combining simple ideas to form more complex ideas:([[http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-10.html][SICP 1.1]])

- *primitive expressions*, which represent the simplest entities the language is concerned with,
- *means of combination*, by which compound elements are built from simpler ones, and
- *means of abstraction*, by which compound elements can be named and manipulated as units.

By the end of this lession you will
- know what a value is and how to create one,
- know what an expression is how to combine them produce new values,
- know what a type is and how it constrains what you can do with expressions, and
- know what a variable is and how to use them as simple means of abstraction.

** Values

#+ATTR_LATEX: :height .7\textheight

** Expressions

- value :: a well-defined chunk of data in memory
- expression :: a sequence of symbols that can be *evaluated* to produce a value

When you an expression into the Python REPL, Python evaluates it and prints its value.

#+begin_src python
>>> 1
1
>>> 3.14
3.14
>>> "pie"
'pie'
#+end_src

The simplest expressions are *literal* values, as in the examples above.

- literal :: the textual representation of a value in source code.

Compound expressions combine values using operators.  Here the ~+~ operator combines the two literal values ~2~ and ~3~ -- the *operands* -- to produce the value ~5~:

#+begin_src python
>>> 2 + 3
5
#+end_src

Have a Python REPL session open for this lesson so you can follow along and try your own ideas.

** Types

You can think of a type
- structurally: as an interpretation of the bits comprising a chunk of data,
- denotationally: as a set of values, or
- abstraction-based: as the set of operations available for a type.

All values have types. Python can tell you the type of a value with the built-in ~type~ function:

#+begin_src python
>>> type(1)
<class 'int'>
>>> type(3.14)
<class 'float'>
>>> type("pie")
<class 'str'>
#+end_src

- What's the type of ~'1'~?

** Variables

Think of variable as a name for a value. You bind a value to a variable using an assignment statement (or by passing an argument to a function), after which the variable *denotes* the value:

#+begin_src python
>>> a = "Ok"
>>> a
'Ok'
#+end_src

~=~ is the assignment operator.  An assignment statement has the form:

#+begin_quote
    ~<variable_name> = <expression>~
#+end_quote

You can unbind a variable with the ~del~ function.

#+begin_src python
>>> del(a)
>>> a
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'a' is not defined
#+end_src

Variable names, or identifiers, may contain letters, numbers, or underscores and may not begin with a number.

  #+begin_src python
  >>> 16_candles = "Molly Ringwald"
  #+end_src

** Keywords

Python reserves keywords for its own use.

#+begin_src python
>>> from keyword import kwlist
>>> import math
>>> numrows = 5
>>> numcols = math.ceil(len(kwlist) / numrows)
>>> for row in range(numrows):
...     for col in range(0, numrows * numcols, numrows):
...         kw = kwlist[row+col] if row+col < len(kwlist) else ''
...         print(f'{kw:<12}', end='')
...     print()
...
False       assert      continue    except      if          nonlocal    return
None        async       def         finally     import      not         try
True        await       del         for         in          or          while
and         break       elif        from        is          pass        with
as          class       else        global      lambda      raise       yield
#+end_src

** Statements vs Expressions

Expressions have values, statements only have effects -- like binding a variable to a value or or effecting control flow in a program. Assignment using ~=~ is a statement -- it cannot be used where a value is expected.

#+begin_src python
>>> while guess = input("Guess a number: "):
...     if guess == "7":
...         break
  Input In [42]
    while guess = input("Guess a number: "):
          ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax. Maybe you meant '==' or ':=' instead of '='?
#+end_src

Since version 3.8, Python provides the "walrus" operator, ~:=~, which creates an assignment expression, where the assigned value is the value of the expression:

#+begin_src python
>>> while guess := input("Guess a number: "):
...     if guess == "7":
...         break
...
Guess a number: 1
Guess a number: 7
>>>
#+end_src

Note that ~while~ and ~if~ are statements -- they don't produce values, they create effects.

We will see a few cases in future lessons where the walrus operator is helpful.

** Aside: The Sizes of Types

One of the convenient things about Python is that you don't have to worry about overflow or underflow[fn:1]. For example, as in mathematics, the set ~int~ is unbounded:

#+begin_src python
>>> import sys
>>> x = sys.maxsize
>>> x
9223372036854775807 # That's ~ 9.2 quintillion, i.e., 9.2e+18
>>> x = x + 1
>>> x
9223372036854775808
>>>
#+end_src

But you should consider ~sys.maxsize~, the word size of your processor (64 bits in this example, since ~sys.maxsize~ $= 2^{63} - 1$), to be the practical limit, because it's the theoretical limit [fn:2] of addressable RAM and thus the largest possible (but certainly impractical) array you could store in main memory and therefore, as you'll learn later, the largest possible list index.

In many other programming languages, size limits can crop up in sometimes amusing ways, [[https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/12/gangnam-style-overflows-int_max-forces-youtube-to-go-64-bit/][Gangnam Style!]]

[fn:1] In regular Python you don't have to worry about type size limits, but in scientific Python, which relies on libraries written in C, C++ and Fortran you do.
[fn:2] Not strictly true, but practically true.

** Types as Sets of Operations

Types determine which operations are available on values. For example, exponentiation is defined for numbers (like int or float):

#+begin_src python
>>> 2**3
8
#+end_src

... but not for ~str~ (string) values:

#+begin_src python
>>> "pie"**3
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for ** or pow(): 'str' and 'int'
#+end_src

This is the primary way to think about types in Python.

** Overloaded Operators

Some operators are overloaded, meaning they have different meanings when applied to different types. For example, + means addition for numbers and concatenation for strings:

#+begin_src python
>>> 2 + 2
4
>>> "Yo" + "lo!"
'Yolo!'
#+end_src

~*~ means multiplication for numbers and repetition for strings:

#+begin_src python
>>> 2 * 3
6
>>> "Yo" * 3
'YoYoYo'
>>> 3 * "Yo"
'YoYoYo'
#+end_src

** Expression Evaluation

Mathematical expressions are evaluated using precedence and associativity rules as you would expect from math:

#+begin_src python
>>> 2 + 4 * 10
42
#+end_src

If you want a different order of operations, use parentheses:

#+begin_src python
>>> (2 + 4) * 10
60

#+end_src

Note that precedence and associativity rules apply to overloaded versions of operators as well:

#+begin_src python
>>> "Honey" + "Boo" * 2
'HoneyBooBoo'
#+end_src

*** Active Review

- How could we modify the expression above to evaluate to 'HoneyBooHoneyBoo' ?

** Python is Dynamically Typed

Python is dynamically typed, meaning that types are not resoved until run-time. This means two things practically:

1. Values have types, variables don't:
   #+begin_src python
   >> a = 1
   >>> type(a)
   <class 'int'>
   >>> a = 1.1 # would be disallowed in a statically typed language
   >>> type(a)
   <class 'float'>
   #+end_src
2. Python doesn't report type errors until run-time. We'll see many examples of this fact.

*** Active Review

Evaluate the following expressions in the Python REPL.  Be sure to type them exactly as written.

- ~2 + 3~
- ~"2" + "3"~
- ~"2" + 3~
- ~2 + "3"~

** Type Conversions

Convert a value to a different type by applying conversions named after the target type.

#+begin_src python
>>> int(2.9)
2
>>> float(True)
1.0
>>> int(False)
0
>>> str(True)
'True'
>>> int("False")
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'False'
#+end_src

*** Active Review

Modify the following expressions to produce the indicated results.

- ~"2" + 3~ (we want ~"23"~)
- ~2 + "3"~ (we want ~5~)

** Boolean Values

There are ~10~ kinds of people:

- those who know binary, and
- those who don't.

** Python Booleans

In Python, boolean values have the ~bool~ type. Four kinds of boolean
expressions:

- ~bool~ literals: ~True~ and ~False~
- ~bool~ variables
- expressions formed by combining non-~bool~ expressions with comparison operators
- expressions formed by combining ~bool~ expressions with logical operators

** Comparison Operators

- Equal to: ~==~, like $=$ in math

    - Remember, ~=~ is assignment operator, ~==~ is comparison operator!

- Not equal to: ~!=~, like $\ne$ in math
- Greater than: ~>~, like $>$ in math
- Greater than or equal to: ~>=~, like $\ge$ in math

#+begin_src python
1 == 1 # True
1 != 1 # False
1 >= 1 # True
1 > 1  # False
#+end_src

*** Active Review

- What is the value of ~"foo" == "Foo"~?
- What is the value of ~"foo" > "Foo"~?

** Logical Operators

The values produced by logial operators are often shown in truth tables:

+-------+-------+---------+-----------+----------+
| a     | b     | not a   | a and b   | a or b   |
+-------+-------+---------+-----------+----------+
| False | False | True    | False     | False    |
| False | True  | True    | False     | True     |
| True  | False | False   | False     | True     |
| True  | True  | False   | True      | True     |
+-------+-------+---------+-----------+----------+

Some equivalent Python expressions:

#+begin_src python
True and True  # True
True and False # False
True or False  # True
False or False # False
not True       # False
#+end_src

** Truth in Python

The zero values of built-in types are equivalent to ~False~:

- boolean ~False~
- ~None~
- integer ~0~
- float ~0.0~
- empty string ~""~
- empty list ~[]~
- empty tuple ~()~
- empty dict ~{}~
- empty set ~set()~

All other values are equivalent to True.

- Every value in Python is either *truthy* or *falsey* and can be used in a boolean context.

** Short-circuit Evaluation

Logical expressions use short-circuit evaluation:

- ~or~ only evaluates second operand if first operand is ~False~
- ~and~ only evaluates second operand if first operand is ~True~

Guard idiom: ~(b == 0) or print(a / b)~, or ~(b != 0) and print(a / b)~

*** Active Review

What are the values of the following expressions?

- ~True and False~
- ~True and 0~
- ~True and []~
- ~True and None~
- ~type(True and None)~
- ~False or 1~
- ~True or 1~
- ~1 and "done"~
- ~1 == 1 or 0~
- ~1 == 1 and 0~
- ~1 == (1 and 0)~


** Sequences

Sequences are ordered collections of objects -- lists, tuples, and strings.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
>>> boys = ['Stan', 'Kyle', 'Cartman', 'Kenny']
>>> boys[0]
'Stan'
>>> empty = []
>>> also_empty = list()
#+END_SRC

Lists are mutable.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
>>> boys[2] = 'Eric'
>>> boys
['Stan', 'Kyle', 'Eric', 'Kenny']
#+END_SRC

Tuples and strings are immutable.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
>>> pair = 1, 2
>>> pair
(1, 2)
>>> pair[0] = 0
Traceback (most recent call last):
  Input In [37] in <cell line: 1>
    pair[0] = 0
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
#+END_SRC


** Dictionaries and Sets

A dictionary is a map from keys to values.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
>>> capitals = {}
>>> capitals['Georgia'] = 'Atlanta'
>>> capitals['Alabama'] = 'Montgomery'
>>> capitals
{'Georgia': 'Altanta', 'Alabama': 'Montgomery'}
>>> capitals['Georgia']
'Atlanta'
#+END_SRC

Sets have no duplicates, like the keys of a ~dict~. They can be iterated over (we'll learn that later) but can't be accessed by index.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
>>> names = set()
>>> names.add('Ally')
>>> names.add('Sally')
>>> names.add('Mally')
>>> names.add('Ally')
>>> names
{'Ally', 'Mally', 'Sally'}
>>> set([1,2,3,4,3,2,1])  # Removes duplicates
{1, 2, 3, 4}
#+END_SRC


** Values, Variables, and Expressions

- Values are the atoms of computer programs
- Expressions produce values
- We combine values using operators and functions to form compound expressions
- Variables are identifiers that denote values
  - Identifiers also denote functions, classes, modules and packages
- Choose identifiers carefully to create beautiful, readable programs
