# Values and Variables

## Introduction

In this short exercise you will create a series of values and assign them to variables to solidify your knowledge of values, variables, operators, and types.

## Solution Description

For each of the comments below, write the specified Python code. You may do this in the Python interactive shell or by creating a Python script that you run from the command line or import into an interactive Python shell (which runs the code). You could copy the comments below and paste them into a text file with a .py extension to get started with the script approach.

```Python
# Assign the value 3 to the variable a. What is the type of a?
# How do you know the value of a?



# Assign the value 4 to the variable b.



# Assign the result of dividing a by b to the variable d using the / operator.
# What is the type of d?




# Assign the result of dividing a by b to the variable e using the integer floor division operator, //.
# What is the type of e?




# Assign the remainder of the integer division a // b to the variable f.
# This operation is known as `mod` or "modulus" and is represented with % in Python.



# Assign the string value "foo" to the variable x.



# Assign the string value "fighter" to the variable y.



# Assign the value of x + y to the variable z. What is the value of z?



# Add 1 to z with the + operator. What happens?
```
