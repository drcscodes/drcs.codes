# Playlists

## Introduction

In this assignment you will practice data transfer techniques such as
- reading [CSV](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) files,
- using data structures,
- creating [JSON](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html) files, and
- using os tools.

## Problem Description

You have a list of songs in a comma-separated values file and you want to publish it as a playlist to a site that supports the JSPF JSON format for sharing playlists.

## Solution Description

Write a Python program in a file named `csv2jspf.py` that reads a CSV file containing song information and writes the song information to a playlist file in [JSPF](https://www.xspf.org/jspf) JSON format.

### Part 1: Reading the CSV File

1. Create a directory for your solution.
2. Download the [weird-al.csv](weird-al.csv) file to your solution directory to use in testing your program.
3. View the contents of the [weird-al.csv](weird-al.csv) file to determine its structure. Note that the field delimiter is `;`, not `,`.
4. Your program should take a single command-line argument, the name of a CSV song list file to use as input. You may assume that any CSV song list file given to your program will have the same structure as [weird-al.csv](weird-al.csv). You may also assume that any song list file given to your program will have a `.csv` extension.
5. If the file specified on the command line does not exist, report this to the user and exit.
6. Use Pythonâ€™s standard csv module to parse the file into an appropriate data structure in memory.
  - Note that if you do this right the next part of this homework is trivial, so take a look at the next section when deciding how to structure your playlist data.

### Part 2: Creating the JSPF File

Look at the [JSPF specification](https://www.xspf.org/jspf) (which is given as a couple of easily read examples).  Use the base name of the input file (the part before `.csv`) as the `title` of the playlist, yourself as the `creator`, the tracks in `track` (note the badly-named singular noun for list of tracks) come from the records in the CSV input file,  and write the playlist data to a JSPF-formatted JSON file with the same base name as the input file, but with a `.json` extension. The value associated with the top-level `duration` key in the JSPF playlist is the total running time of the playlist in seconds. 


### Sample JSPF File

If you ran your program on the [weird-al.csv(weird-al.csv) input file we provided, your JSPF file would look something like this:

```
{
  "title": "weird-al",
  "creator": "chris",
  "duration": 1986,
  "track": [
    {
      "title": "A Complicated Song (Parody of \"Complicated\" by Avril Lavigne)",
      "duration": 219,
      "creator": "Weird Al Yankovic",
      "album": "Poodle Hat",
      "location": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/a-complicated-song-parody-of-complicated-by-avril-lavigne/206901097?i=206902871",
    },
    {
      "title": "Ebay (Parody of \"I Want It That Way\" by the Backstreet Boys)",
      "duration": 216,
      "creator": "Weird Al Yankovic",
      "album": "Poodle Hat",
      "location": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/ebay-parody-of-i-want-it-that-way-by-the-backstreet-boys/206901097?i=206903768",
    },
    {
      "title": "Fat",

      "location": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/fat/250500424?i=250500433",
    },
    {
      "title": "Eat It",
      "duration": 200,
      "creator": "Weird Al Yankovic",
      "album": "In 3-D",
      "location": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/eat-it/250495308?i=250495319",
    },
    {
      "title": "Smells Like Nirvana",
      "duration": 222,
      "creator": "Weird Al Yankovic",
      "album": "Off the Deep End",
      "location": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/smells-like-nirvana/250495074?i=250495085",
    },
    {
      "title": "Amish Paradise (Parody of \"Gangsta's Paradise\" by Coolio)", 
      "duration": 200, 
      "creator": "Weird Al Yankovic", 
      "album": "Bad Hair Day", 
      "location": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/amish-paradise-parody-of-gangstas-paradise-by-coolio/206900040?i=206900081",
    }, 
    {
      "title": "White & Nerdy (Parody of \"Ridin'\" By Chamillionaire featuring Krayzie Bone)", 
      "duration": 170, 
      "creator": "Weird Al Yankovic", 
      "album": "Straight Outta Lynwood", 
      "location": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/white-nerdy-parody-of-ridin/309731664?i=309732001",
    }, 
    {
      "title": "Party In the CIA (Parody of \"Party In the U.S.A.\" By Miley Cyrus)", 
      "duration": 176, 
      "creator": "Weird Al Yankovic", 
      "album": "Alpocalypse", 
      "location": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/party-in-the-cia-parody-of-party-in-the-u-s-a-by-miley-cyrus/438383158?i=438383166",
    }, 
    {
      "title": "Canadian Idiot (Parody of \"American Idiot\" By Green Day)", 
      "duration": 143, 
      "creator": "Weird Al Yankovic", 
      "album": "Straight Outta Lynwood", 
      "location": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/canadian-idiot-parody-of-american-idiot-by-green-day/309731664?i=309732012",
    }, 
    {
      "title": "Word Crimes", 
      "duration": 223, 
      "creator": "Weird Al Yankovic", 
      "album": "Mandatory Fun", 
      "location": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/word-crimes/891836396?i=891836406",
    }
  ],
}
```

Note that the example above is pretty-printed to look like the [JSPF specification](https://www.xspf.org/jspf) and key-value pairs may appear in any order.

Bonus: Add a `duration` key to the JSPF playlist object whose value is the total running time of the playlist in seconds. 

### Tips and Considerations

- Track duration in the JSPF file is in seconds, but in the input file the track durations are in minutes:seconds format.
- Note the type of the value associated with the `track` key in the JDPF format.
- Using the [CSV](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) and [JSON](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html) modules make this assignment trivial.
