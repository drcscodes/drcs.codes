# Discrete Math

This is a course for people who already know how to program, whether in Python or another language.  It focuses on how Python implements particular programming constructs and emphasizes using Python as it is used in professional settings.  The goal of this course is to get you comfortable with Python at a deeper level than is taught in a typical university CS 1 course so that you can be productive using Python for other tasks such as data analytics and machine learning.

This is a course for people who know how to program at the level of [Programming Principles](../programming-principles/).  It provides the mathematical background necessary to understand the material in [Algorithms](../algorithms/).  This course covers the essential material taught in a typical university discrete math course.
