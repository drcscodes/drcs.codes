% Practical Considerations in Machine Learning

## Overfitting

- Overfitting has occurred when your training error decreases and your test error increases.

- The primary cause of overfitting is noise in the data set.

- More complex models are more likely to overfit.

## Regularization

Constraining the model to prevent overfitting.


## Validation

The most important use of validation is for model selection.

## Cross-Validation?

A resampling technique 

## Occam's Razor

## Sampling Bias

## Data Snooping
