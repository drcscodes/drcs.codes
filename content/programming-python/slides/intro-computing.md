## Computing for Computing Professionals

Many professionals use and even rely on computers, typically with a set software products that are tailored, or can be tailored to their needs. 

- Business leaders use word processors, presentation software, spreadsheets and project managers.
- Doctors use electronic health care records and appointment scheduling systems.
- Lawyers use word processors and specialized legal search engines.
- Accountants use accounting ledger software and spreadsheets.
- Photographers and Videographers use photo and video editing tools.

Computing professionals -- software engineers, data analysts, system administrators, etc. -- use computers in a different, more direct and more general way.

- That "data analyst" category is huge.  Anyone working in STEM falls into this category, because anyone working in STEM analyzes data.  
- Any of the "non-computing" professionals listed above could up their game by using computational data analytics or automating workflows with custom-built computer programs.

This course is an introduction to computing for computing professionals.
