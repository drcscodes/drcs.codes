            <p class="lead">This site houses the materials for computer science
            ("CS") courses created and taught by me, <a
            href="http://chris.simpkins.org/">Christopher
            Simpkins</a> ("Dr. CS"), reorganized and enhanced for web or
            in-person delivery.  Most of these courses originated as Georgia
            Tech courses that I taught to thousands of students, some of these
            originated as customized workshops for programs in data analytics,
            quantitative computational finance, and introductory computing.
            Some of these courses I created out of personal interest or to help
            crystallize lessons I've learned in professional practice.  I am
            currently a senior software engineer at IBM/The Weather Company
            building globe-scale cloud-native web services and I have a keen
            interest in many aspects of computer science and software
            development.</p>

                        feel comfortable with computers. The way a programmer or
                        data scientist uses a computer is often quite different
                        from the way ordinary users do. Topics include basic
                        computer organization, operating system usage
                        (especially command line shells), text editors,
                        character encoding, distributed computing (from a user
                        perspective), version control systems, document
                        preparation systems, static web site creation.</p>

                    <p>A short course in Python for people who already know how
                    to program, perhaps in another language. Covers all the
