            <h1 class="display-4">Dr. CS codes</h1>
            <p class="lead">This site houses the materials for computer science ("CS") courses created and taught by me, <a href="http://chris.simpkins.org/">Christopher Simpkins</a> ("Dr. CS"), reorganized and enhanced for web or workshop delivery.  Most of these courses originated as Georgia Tech courses that I taught to thousands of students or prepared to teach, some of these originated as customized workshops for programs in data analytics, quantitative computational finance, and introductory computing.  Some of these courses I created to help crystallize things I've learned in professional practice.</p>

<p class="lead">I am currently the Senior AI Architect at <a href="https://www.sierrawireless.com/">Semtech/Sierra Wireless</a> building AI/machine learning features for the AirVantage IoT cloud platform.  Previously I led a small team developing globe-scale distributed services at IBM/The Weather Company.  I have broad experience and interest in many aspects of computer science and software development.</p>

    <p class="lead">Courses list their prerequisites, if any, so if you're interested in one of the more advanced courses you can trace the prerequisite chain backwards to create a course of study.</p>
