    <h1>General Project Information</h1>
<p>You will design and implement a database portion of an application using the MySQL relational database system. The Project must be done in groups of 3 - 5 students. Groups of more than 5 or less than 3 will not be allowed.  The project will consist of 3 phases (deliverables).</p>
<p>At the end of the project, each team member should submit a <a href="peer-eval.html">peer evaluation</a>. See <a href="peer-eval.html">peer evaluation instructions</a> for details.</p>
<h2>Phase 1</h2>
<p>Given a problem specification from (a) fictional user(s), create a conceptual EER model of the users' data, a list of semantic constraints that cannot be modeled in EER, and an information flow diagram of a database application suited to the user's problem.</p>
<p>Submit your Phase 1 deliverables in a single PDF file named <code>teamN-phase1.pdf</code>, where N is your team number. For example, if you're Team 3 you'd submit a file named <code>team3-phase1.pdf</code>.</p>
<h2>Phase 2</h2>
<p>Map your (corrected) EER model and semantic constraints from Phase 1 to a relational model and write an SQL script with DDL (<code>create table</code>) statements that will create the (unpopulated) database in MySQL.</p>
<p>Submit your Phase 2 deliverable as a single SQL file named <code>teamN-schema.sql</code>, where N is your team number. For example, if you're Team 3 you'd submit a file named <code>team3-schema.sql</code>.</p>
<h2>Phase 3</h2>
<p>Given the problem specification and your (corrected) relational database schema from Phase 2, write an SQL script with DML (<code>insert</code>) statements to populate the database with data and another SQL script with a set of queries that answer questions provided in the project description.</p>
<p>Submit your Phase 3 deliverable as two SQL files: (remember to substitute your team number for N) <code>teamN-data.sql</code> with SQL <code>insert</code> statements to populate the database you created in Phase 2, and <code>teamN-queries.sql</code> with SQL queries to answer the questions provided in the project description for your semester.</p>
