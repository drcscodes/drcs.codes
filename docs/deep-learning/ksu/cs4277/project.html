    <h1>Deep Learning Semester Project</h1><p>In this project you will apply deep learning to some data set.  You may use your own data or a data set that I provide.</p><p>You may work alone or in a team.  If you work in a team, I will expect a little more from your project.  You may team up with someone outside the class if you are working on a research problem joutside of this class.</p><blockquote>
<p>If you are using this class project to work on research outside the class, I strongly recommend that you try to publish your work.  I will work with you to identify an appropriate publication venue, design your research methodology, and write your paper.</p>
</blockquote><p>You will produce the following deliverables, due at appropriate points during the semester (see the schedule):</p><ul>
<li><strong>Project proposal.</strong>  Describe your data, where it comes from, what you want to get from the data, and why it's interesting.</li>
<li><strong>(Intermediate) Results.</strong>  Based on your stated goals above, report the results (so far) of the deep learning model you developed, using confusion matrices, ROC curves, and any other appropriate performance measures.</li>
<li><strong>Finished research paper.</strong>  A finished research paper ready to submit for publication.  Of course, you may continue to work on it after this class is over.</li>
<li><strong>Presentation.</strong>  A 20-minute conference-style presentation to the class during the last two or three class meetings, depending on how many groups we have.</li>
</ul><p>You will write your proposal, results and finished research paper in &amp;\LaTeX$ using the style files of the venue to which you intend to submit your work, or <a href="https://neurips.cc">NeurIPS</a> style files if you don't (yet) have a target venue.  Your code should be written in Python using the PyTorch deep learning framework.  You should keep your code, data, and paper up to date in a private GitHub repository to which you grant me access.</p>
