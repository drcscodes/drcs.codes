<h1 class=display-4>Dr. CS codes ...</h1>
<p class=lead>This site houses the materials for computer science
("CS") courses created and taught by me, <a href=http://chris.simpkins.org/>Christopher
Simpkins</a> ("Dr. CS"), reorganized and enhanced for web or
in-person delivery. Most of these courses originated as Georgia
Tech courses that I taught to thousands of students, some of these
originated as customized workshops for programs in data analytics,
quantitative computational finance, and introductory computing.
Some of these courses I created out of personal interest or to help
crystallize lessons I've learned in professional practice. I am
currently a senior software engineer at IBM/The Weather Company
building globe-scale cloud-native web services and I have a keen
interest in many aspects of computer science and software
development.</p>

<div class="card disabled">
<h5 class=card-header>Computing for Professionals</h3>
<div class=card-body>
<p class=card-text>Start here, even if you already
feel comfortable with computers. The way a programmer or
data scientist uses a computer is often quite different
from the way ordinary users do. Topics include basic
computer organization, operating system usage
(especially command line shells), text editors,
character encoding, distributed computing (from a user
perspective), version control systems, document
preparation systems, static web site creation.</p>

<h2 style=text-align:center>Computer Science Fundamentals</h2>
<div class=card-deck>
<div class=card>
<h5 class=card-header>Programming Principles</h3>
<div class=card-body>
<p class=card-text>An introduction to programming
principles and computation. Suitable for someone who knows the
basics of computing and, if mastered, would prepare you
for a data structures and algorithms course (typically
CS2) at a university. Together, Introduction to
Computing and this course cover the material found in a
typical university CS 1 course.</p>

<div class=card>
<h5 class=card-header>Discrete Math Essentials</h3>
<div class=card-body>
<p class=card-text>A short course in the essential mathematics of computer science: logic, proofs, sets, functions, combinatorics and number theory. This course provides a minimal preparation for a university-level course in algorithms and data structures, covering about two thirds of the content of a typical university discrete math course.</p>

<h2 style=text-align:center>Data Analytics and Machine Learning</h2>
<div class=card-deck>
<div class=card>
<h5 class=card-header>Intensive Python (WIP)</h5>
<div class=card-body>
<p>A short course in Python for people who already know how
to program, perhaps in another language. Covers all the
basic features of Python in greater depth than would be
taught in a first course in programming. This course
prepares students well for work that requires Python, such
as data analytics using the Python stack or software
engineering using Python. Well-suited for workshops or "boot
camps."</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class=card>
<h5 class=card-header>Data Manipulation</h5>
<p>The acquisition, representation, transformation, storage and
presentation of data with an introduction to the tools of data
analytics. Topics include file I/O, text data storage and
exchange formats, text processing, web mining, SQL databases,
and essential elements of the SciPy stack -- NumPy, Pandas, and
Matplotlib. Requires Python skill at the level of Intensive
Python.</p>
<p><a class="btn btn-primary disabled" href=data-manipulation/ role=button>View Course</a></p>
</div>
<div class=card>
<h5 class=card-header>Machine Learning</h5>
<p>An introduction to machine learning covering the material
typically taught in a university senior undergraduate or
graduate introduction to machine learning. This course covers a
broad range of fundamental machine learning theory with an
emphasis on conceptual understanding, with brief introductions
to practical machine learning.</p>

<h2 style=text-align:center>Languages for Large Software Systems</h2>
<div class=card-deck>
<div class=card>
<h5 class=card-header>Java OOP</h5>
<p>An introduction to Java and object-oriented programming for someone with a preparation equivalent to
a university CS1 course. Based on a course Dr. CS taught to thousands of CS majors at Georgia Tech
for six years.</p>
<p><a class="btn btn-primary disabled" href=java-oop/ role=button>View Course &#187;</a></p>
</div>
<div class=card>
<h5 class=card-header>Modern C++</h5>
<p>Modern C++ using the latest standard supported by GCC/Clang. Covers much of the same material as OOP
in Java.</p>

<h5 class=card-header>Databases</h5>
<p>Fundamental database concepts, conceptual entity-relationship modeling, relational database theory,
database design through Boyce-Codd Normal Form, Structured Query Language (SQL), database
application development, storage and indexing schemes, and an introduction to other important
database paradigms such as document-oriented, key-value and distributed databases.</p>
