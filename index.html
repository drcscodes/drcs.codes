Most of these courses originated as Georgia Tech courses that I taught to thousands of students or prepared to teach, some of these originated as customized workshops for programs in data analytics, quantitative computational finance, and introductory computing. Some of these courses I created out of personal interest or to help crystallize lessons I've learned in professional practice.</p><p class=lead>I am currently a senior software engineer at IBM/The Weather Company building globe-scale cloud-native distributed systems and I have a keen interest in many aspects of computer science and software development. Courses list their prerequisites, if any, so if you're interested in one of the more advanced courses you can trace the prequisite chain backwards to create a course of study.</p></div><h2 style=text-align:center>Computer Science Fundamentals</h2><div class=card-deck><div class=card><h5 class=card-header>Programming Principles</h3><div class=card-body><p class=card-text>An introduction to programming principles and computation.
