At the end of this lesson you will
understand the basic collections into which we can group objects, and know how to count several kinds of subsets of objects within collecions. Lists A list is an ordered sequence of elements denoted in literal form with objects â€“ the elements or entries - enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas, e.g.:
$$ (a, b, c) $$</description></item><item><title>Getting Started</title><link>https://DrCS.codes/discrete-math/getting-started/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://DrCS.codes/discrete-math/getting-started/</guid><description>Getting Started These instructions are for installing the necessary tools and Python components for this course. We use the Python.org distribution of Python, but if you already have another distribution, such as Anaconda, that will work fine as long as it includes Python &amp;gt;= 3.7, pip, and venv.
Ubuntu/WSL2 If you are using Windows 10 or 11, install WSL2, the Windows Subsystem for Linux, Version 2. WSL2 provides a very nice Linux environment, including a full Linux kernel and distribution of your choosing (I will use the latest Ubuntu in demonstrations).</description></item><item><title>Introduction to Logic</title><link>https://DrCS.codes/discrete-math/slides/intro-logic/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://DrCS.codes/discrete-math/slides/intro-logic/</guid><description>Introduction to Logic Logic A foundational branch of mathematics (the other foundation is set theory) that deals with the assignment of truth values to statements, also called deduction or proof.
Statements, a.k.a., sentences, are either true, false, or neither. Propositions are either true or false. Axioms are propositions that are assumed to be true. Consider them the starting rules of a system. Example:

Empty set: $\varnothing$ Integers: $\mathbb{Z}$ Natural numbers: $\mathbb{N}$ Real numbers: $\mathbb{R}$ Rational numbers: $\mathbb{Q}$ Cartesian Product ordered paris of elements from multiple sets
Subsets If $A \subseteq B$, then no element of $A$ is not in $B$.
Power Sets Powerset of $A$, $\mathcal{P}(A)$ is the set of all subsets of $A$. There are $2^{|A|}$ subsets of $A$.
Set Union Like OR. $A \cup B$ is a set of all elements of either $A$ or $B$.</description></item></channel></rss>
